This project was presented in the [Knowledge Prompting Hackathon](https://king-s-knowledge-graph-lab.github.io/knowledge-prompting-hackathon/).

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/london-project.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>

        The aim of the project was to develop an agent (i.e. LLM) to collaboratively create a comprehensive knowledge graph with a domain expert. This involves crafting both the graph's structure and content interactively, with the agent taking the lead.

I also enjoyed the city with friends :)
