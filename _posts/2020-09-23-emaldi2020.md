I contributed to *Blockchain-mediated Collaboration of Citizens in Open Government Processes* {% cite emaldi2020 %}, a work presented in the [5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)](https://2020.splitech.org/) conference.

This work explores how sustainable citizen collaboration to foster Open Government can be achieved by means of Blockchain-based solution. The technical feasibility and economic viability of a set of extensions of CKAN tool, bringing together Internet of People (IoP) related technologies such as Blockchain and crowdsourcing, to address sustainability in Open Government Portals is analysed. For that, a use case validation is performed, and the costs of its deployment assessed. The aim is to show how IoP promoting technologies enhance Public Administration (PA) and citizen collaboration to meet common interest objectives.
