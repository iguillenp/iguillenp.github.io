## Work plan
> **Duration:** 1 April to 7 July 2024

**Main Objective:** To conduct research in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on hate speech detection and political discourse analysis, with a special focus on Spanish and Italian discourses.
Activities:
- *Literature review*: Explore and review existing literature on hate speech detection and political discourse analysis in NLP. Analyse previous research related to case studies in Spanish and Italian.
- *Collaboration with the Content-Centric Computing group*: Work in close collaboration with the researchers and students of the group. Participate in regular meetings to discuss research progress and receive feedback.
- *Data collection*: Collect and prepare relevant datasets in Spanish and Italian for the analysis of hate and political discourses.
- *Model development*: Design and develop NLP algorithms and models for hate speech detection and political discourse analysis. Implement natural language processing techniques for data pre-processing and analysis.
- *Evaluation and validation*: Evaluate the performance of the developed algorithms and models using existing metrics and develop own if needed. Validate results through rigorous testing and statistical analysis.
- *Preparation of reports and documents*: Document the research process, including methods, results and conclusions. Prepare technical reports and scientific papers for possible publication in relevant conferences and journals.

**Participation in the LREC-COLING 2024 conference**: Volunteer to attend the conference to learn about the latest developments in the field of NLP. Networking with other professionals and sharing research experiences.

## Activity during the stay
- I presented a poster at the COMETE (COMputer SciEnce DeparTmEnt) PhD Workshop on my activity in political discourse analysis through ontologies.
- I volunteered during the LREC-COLING 2024 conference and was able to attend the conference.
