title: "Dictionary LODification using Wikibase: Quechua language"
date: 2022-06-3 0:0:00
description: "The aim of the project was to create a LOD version of a dictionary for the endangered South American language Quechua on Wikibase. The project began with the identification of suitable resources. Next there was the preprocessing and setup stage. This latter included: setting up QICHWABASE, programming a bot as well as normalising, cleaning and refining the data identified in the first phase. A pre-set ontological Wikibase application profile was identified as a model and was subsequently populated. Finally the data was published and a SPARQL endpoint made available."
