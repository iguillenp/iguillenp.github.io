# Dictionary LODification using Wikibase: Quechua language

> **Participants:** Valeria Caruso, Ibai Guillén, Elwin Huaman
>
> **Tutor:** David Lindemann

Presented in the [4th Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD-22)](https://datathon2022.linkeddata.es/) was the **winner of the best mini-project award**.

The [SD-LLOD-22](https://datathon2022.linkeddata.es/) datathon has the main goal of giving people from industry and academia practical knowledge in the field of Linked Data applied to Linguistics. The final aim is to allow participants to migrate their own (or other’s) linguistic data and publish them as Linked Data on the Web and/or develop applications on top of Linguistic Linked Data. This datathon series is unique in its topic worldwide and continues from the success of the previous editions in 2015 and 2017 in Cercedilla (Spain), and in 2019 in Dagstuhl (Germany). This edition is sponsored and organised by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) through NexusLinguarum, the “European network for Web-centred linguistic data science” COST Action (CA18209, https://nexuslinguarum.eu/) and funded by the European Union.

        The aim of the project was to create a LOD version of a dictionary for the endangered South American language Quechua on Wikibase. The project began with the identification of suitable resources. Next there was the preprocessing and setup stage. This latter included: setting up QICHWABASE, programming a bot as well as normalising, cleaning and refining the data identified in the first phase. A pre-set ontological Wikibase application profile was identified as a model and was subsequently populated. Finally the data was published and a SPARQL endpoint made available.
