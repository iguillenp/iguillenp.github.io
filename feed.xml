The final aim is to allow participants to migrate their own (or other’s) linguistic data and publish them as Linked Data on the Web and/or develop applications on top of Linguistic Linked Data. This datathon series is unique in its topic worldwide and continues from the success of the previous editions in 2015 and 2017 in Cercedilla (Spain), and in 2019 in Dagstuhl (Germany). This edition is sponsored and organised by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) through NexusLinguarum, the “European network for Web-centred linguistic data science” COST Action (CA18209, https://nexuslinguarum.eu/) and funded by the European Union.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/qichwabase-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/qichwabase-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/qichwabase-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/qichwabase.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> The aim of the project was to create a LOD version of a dictionary for the endangered South American language Quechua on Wikibase.

This is a serious problem for recommender systems (RS) or similar aplications since personal data (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics, behavioural, etc.) are the most useful for generating tailored correlations and predictions. To cope with this issue, this work proposes a recommender system that safeguards the user privacy by using a Federated Learning approach (FL). To this end, this article takes as the baseline an already existing centralized RS that uses all the data from users in a clear manner. This baseline RS is based on Factor Machines and it aims to employ persuasion strategies adapted to the user to increase energy awareness and change their consumption habits in the work environment. In order to test the performance of the FL-based distributed RS, the real dataset used (N=678) have been separated into four subsets mimicking a segmentation by country of origin (Austria, UK, Spain and Greece). Each country can create an artificial intelligence model suitable for its users that will be sent to a central server where the aggregation of models will take place and the improved global model will be returned back to each country. The simulation of this FL strategy is performed with four Raspberry Pi's reflecting each country and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used as the aggregation server. The generated model not only increases the privacy of the users as no raw data travels to the central server but also improves the reliability of the recommendations.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blockchain-mediated Collaboration of Citizens in Open Government Processes</title><link href="https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blockchain-mediated Collaboration of Citizens in Open Government Processes"/><published>2020-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020/"><![CDATA[<p>I contributed to <a class="citation" href="#emaldi2020">(Emaldi et al., 2020)</a>, a work presented in the <a href="https://2020.splitech.org/">5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)</a> conference.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work explores how sustainable citizen collaboration to foster Open Government can be achieved by means of Blockchain-based solution. The technical feasibility and economic viability of a set of extensions of CKAN tool, bringing together Internet of People (IoP) related technologies such as Blockchain and crowdsourcing, to address sustainability in Open Government Portals is analysed. For that, a use case validation is performed, and the costs of its deployment assessed. The aim is to show how IoP promoting technologies enhance Public Administration (PA) and citizen collaboration to meet common interest objectives.]]></summary></entry></feed>
