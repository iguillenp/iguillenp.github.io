It will take place on 26-27 June 2023 in Abacws, the brand-new building for the School of Computer Science and the School of Mathematics at Cardiff University. The workshop is especially intended to NLP practitioners and researchers, but everyone would be welcome. Registration is free, but the capacity is limited.</p> <h2 id="motivation">🧭Motivation</h2> <p>Social networks play a fundamental role in political discourse. They have changed the way politics is made and consumed. Political parties use social media, such as Twitter, to share their opinion on news and events. During the electoral campaign, these social networks are a strategic tool to convince the electorate. The interaction generated on these networks generates ideological debates that have a direct impact on electoral results.</p> <p>The speech shared by these organisations on social media is usually different from the speech shared through other channels. The immediacy of social media and discussions can produce <strong>inconsistencies in the speech</strong> of organisations over time. This can involve false promises (discrepancy between rhetoric and action), changes of opinion, or contradictions around a given subject.</p> <p>The electoral campaign’s objective is to get as many votes as possible. This motivates political parties to share news that favours them or harms their opponents. Sometimes the veracity of the news is not checked and they share hoaxes, producing a <strong>bias</strong> in the electorate <strong>through fake news</strong>.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="️proposed-solution">⚠️Proposed solution</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cardiff24-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> Working with cross-channel content have several difficulties. To face these complications we propose an ontology-based approach. From the definition of ontologies ([“*specification of a conceptualization*”](http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html)), we find in them the way to specify the concepts, knowledge and relations we wanted to manage. We build an ontology in which the speeches produced by the same organisation in a temporal space coexist and can be exploited. We assume that a speech is any content published by the same entity, whatever its type, channel and size. This abstraction allow us to work with the speeches generated by any organisation at any time, regardless of the channel through where the information was published. These organisations could be governments, business, political parties, etc. It allow different organisations to coexist and be recognised. Both in the speeches they produce and in those in which they are mentioned, quoted or referenced. In addition, it allow the speeches to be divided by themes and by time. </div> </div> <h2 id="future-work">🔜Future work</h2> <p>We defined several tasks that could be carried out as future work with our infrastructure:</p> <ol> <li>Discrepancy Identification between Rhetoric and Action. <ol> <li>Detect political parties social media posts that correspond to political proposals.</li> <li>Identify incompatible political proposals between parties. Or find similar ones.</li> <li>Identify political parties opinion in social media about other parties political proposals.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Inconsistency Detection in Political Speech. <ol> <li>Contradiction in the speech: Detect which political proposals that where criticised by a political party in the social media are present in its party manifesto.</li> <li>Inconsistencies in speech: Detect whether the above occurs but with the political manifesto of the previous or the following year.</li> <li>Detect changes of opinion about a certain topic.

I presented a paper <em>A Recommender System that safeguards the user privacy through Federated Learning</em> <a class="citation" href="#guillen2021b">(Guillén et al., 2021)</a>, containing the results of my bachelor’s thesis <a class="citation" href="#guillen2021a">(Guillén-Pacho, 2021)</a>.</p> <p>Nowadays, there are more and more legal and ethical limitations when it comes to managing personal data. This is a serious problem for recommender systems (RS) or similar aplications since personal data (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics, behavioural, etc.) are the most useful for generating tailored correlations and predictions. To cope with this issue, this work proposes a recommender system that safeguards the user privacy by using a Federated Learning approach (FL). To this end, this article takes as the baseline an already existing centralized RS that uses all the data from users in a clear manner. This baseline RS is based on Factor Machines and it aims to employ persuasion strategies adapted to the user to increase energy awareness and change their consumption habits in the work environment. In order to test the performance of the FL-based distributed RS, the real dataset used (N=678) have been separated into four subsets mimicking a segmentation by country of origin (Austria, UK, Spain and Greece). Each country can create an artificial intelligence model suitable for its users that will be sent to a central server where the aggregation of models will take place and the improved global model will be returned back to each country. The simulation of this FL strategy is performed with four Raspberry Pi’s reflecting each country and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used as the aggregation server. The generated model not only increases the privacy of the users as no raw data travels to the central server but also improves the reliability of the recommendations.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="conference"/><category term="paper"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Recommender System that safeguards the user privacy through Federated Learning]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)</title><link href="https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)"/><published>2020-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iguillenp.github.io/blog/2020/emaldi2020/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="blockchain-mediated-collaboration-of-citizens-in-open-government-processes">Blockchain-mediated Collaboration of Citizens in Open Government Processes</h2> <p>I contributed to <em>Blockchain-mediated Collaboration of Citizens in Open Government Processes</em> <a class="citation" href="#emaldi2020">(Emaldi et al., 2020)</a>, a work presented in the <a href="https://2020.splitech.org/">5th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)</a> conference.</p> <p>This work explores how sustainable citizen collaboration to foster Open Government can be achieved by means of Blockchain-based solution.
